# Changelog

All notable changes to MiniJinja are documented here.

# Unreleased

- Added custom autoescape settings.
- Added custom formatters.
- Restructured engine internals for greater clarity.
- Added support for rendering to `io::Write`.  (#111)
- Make it impossible to implement `Fitler`, `Test`
  or `Function` from outside the crate (sealed the traits).

# 0.20.0

- Remove internal refcounts from environment.
- Changed `Object` and `FunctionArgs` interface to take
  arguments by reference. (#101)
- `sync` mode is now always enabled. (#104)
- Removed meta API. (#105)
- Error no longer implements `PartialEq`.
- Simplified the function interface.  Filters, tests and global
  functions can now directly return values instead of results. (#107)
- MiniJinja no longer silently iterates over non iterable values.

## Breaking Changes

- The `meta` API is gone without replacement.
- `Object::call_method` and `Object::call` now take the arguments
  as `&[Value]` instead of `Vec<Value>`.
- `Object::call_method`, `Object::call` and `FunctionArgs::from_values`
  now take the arguments as `&[Value]` instead of `Vec<Value>`.
- The error object used to implement `PartialEq` but this was implemented
  by comparing the error kind instead.  Explicitly use the `.kind()`
  method of the error if you want the same behavior.
- `DebugInfo` is no longer exposed.  This might come back if a better
  API can be found.

# 0.15.0

- Bumped minimum version requirement to 1.43.
- Internal refactorings.

# 0.14.0

- Added `bool` filter.
- Added `meta` API. (#55)
- Added support for `ignore missing` in include tags. (#56)
- Added support for choices in include tags. (#57)

# 0.13.0

- Removed deprecated functionality.
- Fix an panic in debug error printing. (#49)

# 0.12.0

- Deprecated `Primitive` and `as_primitive`.
- Deprecated `as_f64`.
- Truthiness of values is now checking container length.  Previously containers
  were always true, now they are only true if they are not empty.
- Strings and safe strings no longer compare the same.
- Changed list and map string output to have delimiters and debug printing.
- Added `batch` and `slice` filter.
- Added the new `items` filter.
- Removed value internal distinction between maps and structs.
- Added `list` filter.
- Added `first` and `last` filters.
- Added `round` and `abs` filters.
- Implemented integer division operator (``//``) and changed division to always
  return floats like documented and to match the Jinja2 implementation.  To
  make this more convenient whole integer floats are now handled like integers in
  some situations.
- Added `recursive` support to for loops.
- Merged `builtin_filters`, `builtin_tests` and `builtin_functions` features
  into `builtins`.
- Added `value::serializing_for_value` to check if serialization is taking place
  for MiniJinja.
- The `Value` type now supports deserialization.  This feature can be disabled
  by removing the default `deserialization` feature.
- Removed optional `memchr` dependency as it does not appear to be useful.

# 0.11.0

*Yanked* — this was a release from the wrong branch

# 0.10.0

- Restructured the value type internally to be simpler and not use unsafe at the
  cost of slightly larger memory footprint. (#30)
- Added `debug` support.  If the debug mode is enabled, errors now carry a lot of
  useful debug information and an alternative representation when formatted into
  strings that show the context of the template where it went all wrong. (#31)
- Added automatic string interning of object/map keys in values. This feature can
  be disabled by removing the default `key_interning` feature. (#35)
- Removed deprecated `Single` type.

# 0.9.0

- Remove one trailing newline to be consistent with Jinja2.
- Resolved a bug where borrowed keys on dynamic objects could not be looked up. (#29)

# 0.8.2

- Restored unconditional compatibility with 1.42.

# 0.8.1

- Turned on all features for the docs on docs.rs

# 0.8.0

- Added `context!` and deprecate `Single`.
- Correctly report template file names in errors.
- Added the `source` method on templates.
- Introduced `State` type and changed parameter to functions from
  `&Environment` to `&State`.
- Added `debug` global.
- Added `tojson` filter.
- Added `urlencode` filter.

# 0.7.0

- Made the `source` method on error be bound to `Send` and `Sync`.

# 0.6.0

- Added `default` filter.
- Added `startingwith` and `endingwith` tests.
- Added global variables and function support.
- Added `range` function.

# 0.5.0

- Added `v_htmlescape` feature to turn on a faster HTML escaping.
- Export `HtmlEscape` helper.
- Also escape `/` in HTML escaping like `v_htmlescape` does.
- Changed return value type of `get_template` to be a result rather than an
  option.
- Added `Source` behind the `source` feature to support loading of templates
  at runtime without lifetime complications.
- Initial auto escaping decision is now made when the template is loaded from
  the environment and not when they are added.
- The environment can now be cloned.
- Added `sync` feature that can be disabled to disable the ability to send
  objects to other threads where that comes at a cost.
- `safe` and `escape` are now always provided as filters.
- Added support for `self.block_name()`.
- Fixed incorrect behavior where `super()` did not allow filters.
- Added `{% filter %}` blocks.

# 0.4.0

- Added the ability to roundtrip arbitrary values via the serialize interface.
- Added support for tuple unpacking in lists.
- Added dictsort filter.
- Introduced a new trait `ArgType` to handle argument conversions for filters
  and tests so optonal arguments can exist.

- Added `trim` filter.
- Added `join` filter.
- Added `number` test.
- Added `string` test.

  filter and test functions.
