# Todo Filter Function Implementation
**Status:** Refining

## Original Todo
we want to implement a todo filter function.  There is a reference implementation as a normal function on github but we need to convert it: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/816 â€” Ideally we find a way to take that PR and update it.
