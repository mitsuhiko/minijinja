//!   <p><strong>MiniJinja: a powerful template engine for Rust with minimal dependencies</strong></p>
//! </div>
//!
//! MiniJinja is a powerful but minimal dependency template engine for Rust which
//! is based on the syntax and behavior of the
//! [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) template engine for Python.  It's
//! implemented on top of [`serde`].  The goal is to be able to render a large
//! chunk of the Jinja2 template ecosystem from Rust with a minimal engine and to
//! leverage an alredy existing ecosystem of editor integrations.
//!
//! ```jinja
//! {% for user in users %}
//!   <li>{{ user.name }}</li>
//! {% endfor %}
//! ```
//!
//! # Why MiniJinja
//!
//! MiniJinja by its name wants to be a good default choice if you need a little
//! bit of templating with minimal dependencies.  It has the following goals:
//!
//! * Well documented, compact API
//! * Minimal dependencies, reasonable compile times and decent runtime performance
//! * Stay close as possible to Jinja2
//! * Support for expression evaluation
//! * Support for all `serde` compatible types
//! * Excellent test coverage
//! * Support for dynamic runtime objects with methods and dynamic attributes
//!
//! # Template Usage
//!
//! To use MiniJinja one needs to create an [`Environment`] and populate it with
//! templates.  Afterwards templates can be loaded and rendered.  To pass data
//! one can pass any serde serializable value.  The [`context!`] macro can be
//! used to quickly construct a template context:
//!
//! ```
//! use minijinja::{Environment, context};
//!
//! let mut env = Environment::new();
//! env.add_template("hello", "Hello {{ name }}!").unwrap();
//! let tmpl = env.get_template("hello").unwrap();
//! println!("{}", tmpl.render(context!(name => "John")).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! ```plain
//! Hello John!
//! ```
//!
//! For super trivial cases where you need to render a string once, you can
//! also use the [`render!`] macro which acts a bit like a replacement
//! for the [`format!`] macro.
//!
//! # Expression Usage
//!
//! MiniJinja — like Jinja2 — allows to be used as expression language.  This can be
//! useful to express logic in configuration files or similar things.  For this
//! purpose the [`Environment::compile_expression`] method can be used.  It returns
//! an expression object that can then be evaluated, returning the result:
//!
//! ```
//! use minijinja::{Environment, context};
//!
//! let env = Environment::new();
//! let expr = env.compile_expression("number < 42").unwrap();
//! let result = expr.eval(context!(number => 23)).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(result.is_true(), true);
//! ```
//!
//! This becomes particularly powerful when [dynamic objects](crate::value::Object) are
//! exposed to templates.
//!
//! # Custom Filters
//!
//! ```
//! use minijinja::{Environment, context};
//!
//! let mut env = Environment::new();
//! env.add_filter("repeat", str::repeat);
//! env.add_template("hello", "{{ 'Na '|repeat(3) }} {{ name }}!").unwrap();
//! let tmpl = env.get_template("hello").unwrap();
//! println!("{}", tmpl.render(context!(name => "Batman")).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! ```plain
//! Na Na Na Batman!
//! ```

//! # Optional Features
//!
//! MiniJinja comes with a lot of optional features, some of which are turned on by
//! default.  If you plan on using MiniJinja in a library, please consider turning
//! off all default features and to opt-in explicitly into the ones you actually
//! need.
//!
//! <details><summary><strong style="cursor: pointer">Configurable Features</strong></summary>
//!
//! There are some additional features that can be enabled:
//!
//! - `source`: enables the `Source` type which helps with dynamic loading of templates.
//! - `v_htmlescape`: enables the `v_htmlescape` dependency which implements a faster HTML
//!   escaping algorithm.
//! - `speedups`: enables all speedups (currently `v_htmlescape`)
//! - `unstable_machinery`: provides access to the internal machinery of the engine.  This
//!   is a forever unstable API which mainly exists to aid debugging complex issues.
//! - `json`: When enabled the `tojson` filter is added as builtin filter as well as
//!   the ability to auto escape via `AutoEscape::Json`.
//! - `urlencode`: When enabled the `urlencode` filter is added as builtin filter.
//! - `preserve_order`: When enable the internal value implementation uses an indexmap
//!   which preserves the original order of maps and structs.
//!
//! Additionally to cut down on size of the engine some default
//! functionality can be removed:
//!
//! - `builtins`: if this feature is removed the default filters, tests and
//!   functions are not implemented.
//! - `debug`: if this feature is removed some debug functionality of the engine is
//!   removed as well.  This mainly affects the quality of error reporting.
//! - `key_interning`: if this feature is removed the automatic string interning in
//!   the value type is disabled.  The default behavior can cut down on the memory
//!   consumption of the value type by interning all string keys used in values.
//! - `deserialization`: when removed this disables deserialization support for
//!   the [`Value`](crate::value::Value) type.
