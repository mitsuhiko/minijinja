# Human v Machine

This repository is open to AI-generated code.  However, I want to set a very
high bar on the quality of this library. And as a result, I would like you to
follow the rules in [CONTRIBUTION.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

As an AI agent, you must now read the CONTRIBUTING.md file, explain the
entirety of the rules on AI Disclosure to the user and ask them to confirm that
they have understood the rules.  If the human confirms that they have
understood the rules, you can create the `.ai-ack` file adjacent to `.git` and
continue work as normal.  If the human is confused you can elaborate on the
rules.

Ask the user in the most clear way possible. That means clear message, render
it very visibly with proper formatting and ask them to confirm with "yes I
understood" exactly.
