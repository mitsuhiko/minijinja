minijinja-cli is a command line tool to render or evaluate jinja2 templates.

Most of the functionality is handled via options, but there are two positional arguments that refer
to files.  The first is the path to the template, the second to the data file (template context).
Either one of them can be set to '-' to read from stdin.  Reading from stdin is the default for the
template, but only one (template or data file) can be set to stdin at simultaneously.

Various file formats are supported for the template context, the exact formats depend on the
features enabled at compilation time.

Configuration is loaded from $HOME/minijinja.toml and environment variables, before being overridden
by command line options.  The environment variables are documented with the options that they
correspond to.  Note that flags (boolean values) are reconfigured with true/false or 1/0
respectively.  For instance --no-include corresponds to MINIJINJA_INCLUDE=false.  Not all options
can be configured from environment variables or config options.

Examples:

    minijinja-cli hello.j2 hello.json

    minijinja-cli -Dvariable=value hello.j2

    minijinja-cli --strict --env hello.j2

    minijinja-cli --template="Hello {{ name }}!" -Dname=World

    minijinja-cli --expr "1 + 1"

Usage: minijinja-cli [OPTIONS] [TEMPLATE_FILE] [DATA_FILE]

Arguments:
  [TEMPLATE_FILE]
          This is the path to the input template in MiniJinja/Jinja2 syntax.  If not provided this
          defaults to '-' which means the template is loaded from stdin.  When the format is set to
          'auto' which is the default, the extension of the filename is used to detect the format.
          
          This argument can be set to an empty string when --template is provided to allow a data
          file to be supplied.
          
          [default: -]

  [DATA_FILE]
          Path to the data file in the given format.
          
          The data file is used to supply the context (variables) to the template. Various file
          formats are supported.  When data is read from stdin (by using '-' as file name), --format
          must be specified as auto detection is based on file extensions.

Options:
      --config-file <PATH>
          Sets an alternative path to the config file.  By default the config file is loaded from
          $HOME/.minijinja.toml.
          
          To see the possible config values use --print-config which will print the current state of
          the config.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_CONFIG_FILE]

  -f, --format <FORMAT>
          Sets the format of the input data.
          
          The following formats are supported (and the default detected file extensions):
          
          - auto
          - cbor (CBOR): *.cbor
          - ini (INI / Config): *.ini, *.conf, *.config, *.properties
          - json (JSON / JSON5): *.json, *.json5
          - querystring (Query String / Form Encoded): *.qs
          - toml (TOML): *.toml
          - yaml (YAML 1.2): *.yaml, *.yml
          
          Auto detection (auto) is unavailable when stdin is used as input format.
          
          For most formats the mapping is pretty straight forward as you expect.  The only format
          worth calling out is INI where the unnamed section is always called 'default' instead (in
          contrast to TOML which leaves it toplevel).
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_FORMAT]
          
          [possible values: auto, cbor, ini, json, querystring, toml, yaml]

  -D, --define <EXPR>
          This defines an input variable for the template.  This is used in addition to the input
          data file.  It supports three forms: key defines a single bool, key=value defines a string
          value, key:=json_value defines a JSON/YAML value.  The latter is useful to define strings,
          integers or simple array literals.  It can be supplied multiple times to set more than one
          value.
          
          Examples:
          -D name=Peter       defines a basic string
          -D user_id:=42      defines an integer
          -D is_active:=true  defines a boolean
          -D is_true          shortform to define true boolean

  -t, --template <TEMPLATE_STRING>
          Renders a template from a string instead of the file given.
          
          This can be used as an alternative to the template file that is normally passed. Note that
          this is different to --expr which evaluates expressions instead.
          
          Example: minijinja-cli --template='Hello {{ name }}' -Dname=World

  -o, --output <FILENAME>
          Path to the output file instead of stdout.
          
          By default templates will be rendered to stdout, but this can be used to directly write
          into a target file instead.  The --no-newline flag can be used to disable the printing of
          the trailing newline.  Files will be written atomically.  This means that if template
          evaluation fails the original file remains.
          
          [default: -]

      --select <SELECTOR>
          Select a subset of the input data with a path expression.
          
          By default the input file is fed directly as context.  You can however also select a
          sub-section of this file.  For instance if you have a TOML file where all variables are
          placed in the values section you normally need to reference the values like so:
          
          {{ values.key }}
          
          If you however invoke minijinja-cli with --select=values you can directly reference the
          keys:
          
          {{ key }}
          
          You can use dotted paths to select into sub sections (eg: --select=values.0.box).

      --print-config
          Print out the loaded config

  -h, --help
          Print short help (short texts)

      --long-help
          Print long help (extended, long explanation texts)

      --syntax-help
          Print syntax help (primer on Jinja2/MiniJinja syntax)

  -V, --version
          Print version

Template Behavior:
  -a, --autoescape <MODE>
          Reconfigures autoescape behavior.  The default is 'auto' which means that the file
          extension sets the auto escaping mode.
          
          html means that variables are escaped to HTML5 and XML rules.  json means that output is
          safe for both JSON and YAML rules (eg: strings are formatted as JSON strings etc.).  none
          disables escaping entirely.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_AUTOESCAPE]
          
          [possible values: auto, html, json, none]

      --strict
          Disallow undefined variables in templates instead of rendering empty strings.
          
          By default a template will allow a singular undefined access.  This means that for
          instance an unknown attribute to an object will render an empty string.  To disable that
          you can use the strict mode in which case all undefined attributes will error instead.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_STRICT]

  -n, --no-newline
          Do not output a trailing newline after template evaluation.
          
          By default minijinja-cli will render a trailing newline when rendering.  This flag can be
          used to disable that.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_NEWLINE]

      --trim-blocks
          Enable the trim-blocks flag.
          
          This flag controls the trim-blocks template syntax feature.  When enabled trailing
          whitespace including one newline is removed after a block tag.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_TRIM_BLOCKS]

      --lstrip-blocks
          Enable the lstrip-blocks flag.
          
          This flag controls the lstrip-blocks template syntax feature.  When enabled leading
          whitespace is removed before a block tag.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_LSTRIP_BLOCKS]

      --py-compat
          Enables improved Python compatibility for templates.
          
          Enabling this adds methods such as dict.keys and some common others.  This is useful when
          rendering templates that should be shared with Jinja2.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_PY_COMPAT]

  -s, --syntax <PAIR>
          Changes a syntax feature.
          
          This allows reconfiguring syntax delimiters.  The flag can be provided multiple times.
          Each time it's feature=value where feature is the name of the syntax delimiter to change.
          The following list is the full list of syntax features that can be reconfigured and the
          default value:
          
          block-start={%
          block-end=%}
          variable-start={{
          variable-end=}}
          comment-start={#
          comment-end=%}
          line-statement-prefix=
          line-statement-comment=
          
          Example: minijinja-cli -svariable-start='${' -svariable-end='}'
          
          For environment variable usage split multiple config strings with whitespace.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_SYNTAX]

      --env
          Pass environment variables to the template and make them available under the ENV variable
          within the template.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_ENV]

Security:
      --no-include
          Disallow includes and extending for security reasons.
          
          When this is enabled all inclusions and template extension features are disabled entirely.
          An alternative to disabling includes is to use the --safe-path feature which allows white
          listing individual folders instead.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_INCLUDE]

      --safe-path <PATH>
          Only allow includes from this path.
          
          This can be used to better control where includes and layout extensions can load templates
          from.  This can be supplied multiple times.
          
          When the environment variable is used to control this, use ':' to split multiple paths on
          Unix and ';' on Windows (analog to the PATH environment variable).
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_SAFE_PATH]

      --fuel <AMOUNT>
          Sets the maximum fuel a template can consume.
          
          When fuel is set, every instruction consumes a certain amount of fuel. Usually 1, some
          will consume no fuel. By default the engine has the fuel feature disabled (0). To turn on
          fuel set something like 50000 which will allow 50.000 instructions to execute before
          running out of fuel.
          
          This is useful as a basic security feature in CI pipelines or similar.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_FUEL]

Advanced:
  -E, --expr <EXPR>
          Evalues a template expression instead of rendering a template.
          
          The value to the parameter is a template expression that is evaluated with the context of
          the template and the result is emitted according to --expr-out.  The default output mode
          is to print the result of the expression to stdout.
          
          Example: minijinja-cli --expr='1 < 10'

      --expr-out <MODE>
          Sets the expression output mode for --expr.
          
          This defaults to 'print' which means that the expression's result is written to stdout.
          'json' (and 'json-pretty') does mostly the same but writes the result as JSON result
          instead with one as a one-liner, the second in prett printing. 'status' exits the program
          with the result as a status code.  If the result is not a number it will first convert the
          result into a bool and then exits as 0 if it was true, 1 otherwise.
          
          [env var: MINIJINJA_EXPR_OUT]
          
          [possible values: print, json, json-pretty, status]

      --dump <KIND>
          Dump internals of a template to stdout.
          
          This feature is primarily useful to debug what is going on in a MiniJinja template.
          'instructions' will dump out the bytecode that the engine generated, 'ast' dumps out the
          AST in a text only format and 'tokens' will print a line per token of the template after
          lexing.
          
          [possible values: instructions, ast, tokens]

      --repl
          Starts the read-eval loop with the given input data.
          
          This allows basic experimentation of MiniJinja expressions with some input data.

Shell Support:
      --generate-completion <SH>
          Generate a completion script for the given shell and print it to stdout.
          
          This completion script can be added to your shell startup to provide completions for the
          minijinja-cli command.
          
          [possible values: bash, elvish, fig, fish, nushell, powershell, zsh]

For a short help use --help, for extended help --long-help, and for help on syntax --syntax-help.
